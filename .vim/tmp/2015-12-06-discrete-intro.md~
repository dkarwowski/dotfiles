Honestly, I'll start by mentioning this is just a guess -- however I feel that
the information I go over in this first post will be an important starting
point for later on. When I reach complex topics, I do intend on breaking them
down to hopefully the simplest of forms. However, I want a "higher-level"
understanding using techniques I go over here.

## Sets

So, a set is one of the more basic ideas; a collection of items. We can define
sets using a simple description, such as

$$ A \textrm{ is the set of the first four positive integers} $$

Or we can explicitly list every element in the set

$$ A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} $$

Which way we describe the set depends upon the person writing the paper. The
only restriction is that it must be explicit and accurate. If not explicit
enough, the set is simply no longer tha same.

There are two properties that must be known for sets as well. We have

1. All repititions can be simplified to a set defined without repititions. It
   ends up being always the same.
2. The order of the elements in the set makes no difference, and is always
   equivalent. 

As in, $$ \{1,2\}=\{2,1\}=\{1,1,2\} $$

Finally, we have a description of sets using the "such that" notation, where a
specific definition is given.

$$ A = \{n^2 \mid 0 \le n \le 5 \} $$

In this situation we read the description as "$$A$$ is the set of numbers 
$$n^2$$ such that $$n$$ is between $$0$$ and $$5$$".

### Operations

The operations on sets are our ways of interacting with the elements to create
a new set.

Power Set
: The set of all subsets of S, or all possible ways to break down the
  individual elements. Usually denoted $$P(S)$$.

  $$ P(\{1,2,3\}) = \{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{1,2\}, \{1,3\},
  \{2,3\}, \{1,2,3\}\} $$

Union
: Taking two sets, getting combinations of the elements to determine the
  definition of the new sets. From this, we get

  $$ \{1,2\} \cup \{3,4\}=\{1,2,3,4\} $$

Intersect
: Taking two sets, we create a set out of the elements found in both of the
  individual sets.

  $$ \{1,2,3\} \cap \{2,4\}=\{2\} $$

Relative Complement
: Taking the difference of two sets, or the "subtraction" of two sets.
  
  $$ \{1,2,3\} \setminus \{1,2\} = \{3\} $$

Universal Complement
: Taking the complement of a set relative to the Universal set $$U$$ (the set
  containing all elements that you're considering a subset of). This is defined
  as

  $$ U \setminus A = A' $$

Symmetric Difference
: The elements that are in two different sets, removing the overlap between the
  two.

  $$ A \bigtriangleup B = \{x \mid (x \in A) \oplus (x \in B)\} $$

Cartesian Product
: taking two sets and taking every possible combination of an element from both
  sets.

  $$ A \times B = \{ (a,b) \mid a \in A, b \in B \} $$

### Properties

There are a few properties of sets that are important to keep in mind,
regarding mostly operations.

Cartesian Product
: $$ A \times \emptyset = \emptyset $$

  $$ A \times (B \cup C) = (A\times B) \cup (A \times C) $$

  $$ (A \cup B) \times C = (A \times C) \cup (B \times C) $$

DeMorgan's Law
: $$ (A \cup B)' = A' \cap B' $$

  $$ (A \cap B)' = A' \cup B' $$

## Logic

Alright, next up comes basic logic. We can use logic to prove ridiculous things
(like $$ 0.\bar{9} = 1 $$) or just prove something we already know to make
sense (like $$ \frac{1}{2}=\frac{2}{4} $$).
