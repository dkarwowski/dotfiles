E_GetTypeInfo:
* Grabs the info that is consistent for all entities of that type
* Could contain info such as speed, drag, drawing, mass
* Could have overriden values for specific types
  * Makes for duplicates in some cases, but good for the general
* Takes up less memory since each enemy type only stores some stuff once,
  rather than storing it twice.
