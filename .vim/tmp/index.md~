Hi! I'm David Karwowski, and I'm from Shelton, CT. I'm currently a student at
the University of Connecticut, pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a
Minor in Mathematics.

## This Site

So the majority of this site is dedicated to hosting my blog, **univ to dev**,
which will contain posts that attain to the things I learn in school
(categorized by the class it pertains to), the things I learn in my personal
projects (this website, games/apps I develop), and things I'll occasionally
find interest to look back on. 

As to the things I learn in school, I'll be sticking to the following topics:

 * Programming Languages (CSE4102)
 * Operating Systems (CSE4300)
 * Combinatorics (MATH3250)

Projects that I'm working on will vary time to time, currently I'm looking to
focus on learning C with the SDL2 library to develop a game as well as a basic
engine to go along with it. I'm considering also learning about Raytracing and
seeing what I can learn about that.

 * [Fluss](https://github.com/dkarwowski/fluss) (Pure C with the SDL2 library)
 * [Risky](https://github.com/dkarwowski/risky) (Java using Swing/JavaFX)

As to things of interest, I have no idea what I may find on the internet some
days and decide to look into further. We'll see!

## Myself

A lot of what I have done can be found on my [Resume](/resume), however beyond
that I'd like to go into the fact that I started my programming career back in
2008, the summer when I discovered [MIT OpenCourseWare](ocw.mit.edu). I went
through their introductory course and learned a lot about Python, which I then
stemmed into learning C, C++, and so on.

I joined a [FIRST Robotics](http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) team at
my high school, and began working with two professionals in the field that
helped me learn much more about working on a large scale project and how to
work with a team. I used it as a opportunity to learn more about C++, and to
solidify myself as a Programmer.

Then I went off to [UConn](http://uconn.edu/). I got into the School of
Engineering and began my Computer Science degree, and in the summer of 2015 I
was offered an internship at [Gerber
Technology](http://www.gerbertechnology.com/). I applied myself at the position
and was able to output three different pieces of technology that were
implemented into their [AccuMark
Software](http://www.gerbertechnology.com/accumark-pattern-design-software/).

Now I'm just looking for another internship for my final summer before
graduation, hoping to find something in the area around my school or in Boston,
where I intend to find a career after finishing my degree.
