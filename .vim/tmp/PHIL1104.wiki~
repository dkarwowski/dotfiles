=  Cultural Relativism =

* The thesis that what is right/wrong depends on what moral beliefs are 
  dominant in the culture you live in.
* There are no universal moral truths.
* Don’t do what everyone does, do what the culture believes in.
* Why we think it’s true?
  * “Respect for Cultures”
    * ie different things people do with their dead
  * Tolerance is important
    * allow other people to behave regarding their culture
    * france is arguing to not allow secularism in schools
  * Condemning radical change
    * things are going too fast → gay rights movement/interracial movement
    * cultural change is forced before prepared
    * activists push too hard too quickly, trying to merge cultures the 
      wrong way
  * Religious or moral integrity
    * to be accepting of what people do regarding their religion
      * Hindus with cows, etc
  * Value-neutrality
    * Describe cultures with their own values, no bias

==  Argument from Cultural Differences ==

We have the argument

1. Cultures disagree about what is right and wrong
2. So, what is right and what is wrong is different in different cultures

We can prove this wrong as we have a Psychological idea creating a Moral idea
The structure can also be compared to another invalid argument

1. In the past, cultures disagreed about whether earth is flat or round.
2. So the shape differs in correctness depending on the time period.

This holds the same structure but is definitely invalid

==  Consequences ==

* We can’t have moral heroes because everyone is right
* Moral progress is doubtful because right&wrong aren’t set
* There are different kinds of right 
  * Abolition went from “right” → “right”
* However, there is moral progress, see above
* So, cultural relativism is wrong

==  Assume Correct ==

Why is there so much disagreement?
* Often our moral disagreements are about _facts_.

What about tolerance?
* Do they really have anything to do with each other?
* ie there’s nothing immoral about a crying baby, but one can be intolerant 
  towards it
* ie you can tolerate someone piercing their baby’s ears but morally think 
  it’s wrong

==  Context still matters ==
* Not shaking hands in America would be wrong
* Shaking hands in Japan would be wrong (as would eye contact w/ superiors)

* Must you share dinner w/ your neighbor?
  * share if your neighbor needs it (ie not necessary when both have enough)
* Gossiping about someone’s sex life
  * Not so bad in America, but could be fatal in other countries

= Utilitarianism and Objections =

* These are some ethical principles
* Founded by Bentham, popularized by John Stuart Mill and Immanuel Kent
  * JSM: Paired it with *hedonism*: pursuit of pleasures

== Mill's version ==
    
Sensual Pleasures::
::  Feelings, anything physical such as music.
    
Attitudinal Pleasures::
:: Putting time towards relationships.
:: Getting to make choice of what you do for yourself.

* The right action is that which maximizes overall happiness and minimizes
  overall sufferring
* What counts as happiness?
  * [[#Sensual Pleasures|Sensual]] and [[#Attitudinal Pleasures|attitudinal]]
    pleasures.
* Could be perceived other ways:
  * Whatever you think makes life go best/well

=== Support ===

* Explanations of why you do something end with 'for happiness'.
* What we want for our children, depends on person to person.
* Rational decision making verses moral decision making
  * Taking a hard class that will be helpful -> could get a bad grade but learn
    some really good info.
    
== Objections ==

Does it violate the distinguishing factors between allowing and doing harm?

Is this too demanding?

=== Slavery Objections ===

Imagine there are two islands, Juba and Camaica. On Camaica, everyone is free
however they don't have the best living conditions. On Juba, there are slaves
however everyone is fed well and have certain freedoms such as vacations and
such. Camaicans are trying to emigrate to Juba to be slaves.

We run into the (Hare) objection that:
1. If utilitarianism is true, then Camaica has a moral responsibility to
   institute slavery b/c they're trying to become slaves -- the happier choice.
2. However, slavery is never morally permissible.
3. So, ultilitarianism isn't true.

==== The Defense ====
1. From Earthly experience
  - On Earth, slavery is terrible (steals children, unhealthy, etc).
  - Juba's slavery is defined as slavery that we have not experienced.
  - There are certain freedoms that we are willing to give up.
    - They get moment-to-moment freedom if they don't have overarcing freedom.
2. From human psychology.
  - If we have slavery w/o the freedoms but others wanted to join and were
    happy, then we're faced w/ beinds that aren't human.
  - Humans are by default unhappy without personal freedoms.
  - We don't have the right to determine what other beings choose for
    themselves to make them happy.

=== Integrity Objections ===

Violation of personal integrity.

We are controlling train tracks. You cannot stop the train. If you do nothing,
the train will kill five people. If you pull the level, then only one person
gets killed. In one case, you cannot entirely be blamed. In the other, it is
sort of our own fault. Or, suppose pushing a big guy into the tracks with the
same intention.

*Bernard Williams* comes up with Jim and Indians:
You are Jim and lost, coming up on an Indian tribe. The Indians are about to
kill a group of rebels who are innocent and trying to become better. The Chief
offers Jim to kill one Indian and let the other 19 go free. Or you do nothing
and all twenty get shot.

* Either way, we have the situation where at least one person gets shot. So by
  refraining, we face the consequence of another nineteen getting shot.
* Jim may go on to have an incredible guilty conscience, but is that more
  important than another 19 lives?

1. If utilitarianism was the correct theory, then Jim is obligated to kill one
   Indian.
2. Jim is not morally obligated to kill the Indian (because of your own
   integrity).
3. So, utilitarianism is not the correct theory.

We also have George the Chemist, who is very poor. War has broken out and he's
offered a bomb-making job. He can take the job to make bombs that will kill.
Helps his family. Or someone else will do it faster and deadlier, with his
family suffering in poverty.

1. If utilitarianism is correct, then George is obligated to take the job.
2. George is not obligated to take the job.
3. Utilitarianism is not the correct theory.

==== The Defense ====

What is Integrity?
* Being true to yourself.
* Certain roles' responsibility has to do with what creates their own integrity
  and what makes it important.
  
Does it mean:
* Doing what is in line with one's personal conversation?
  * ie Huck Finn w/o integrity -> has trouble accepting Jim as free man.
  * is the serial killer acting with integrity? -> believes in who he is.

Integrity::
:: Acting in line with your convictions, even when immoral.
:: Acting with convictions as long as they are morally permissible.

This objection is circular because it relies on circular.

* Consider Integrity has nothing to do with Morallity
  * Statement 2. from above (either) cannot work because integrity has nothing
    to do with morallity, and we cannot use integrity for a moral premise.
  * This would mean 2. is not supported making the entire argument unsound.
* Consider Integrity has to do with Morallity
  * Statement 2. is now a valid moral premise, but is this convincing to a
    Utilitarian?
  * Statement 2. relies on the person having integrity leaning towards
    self-serving ideas, so a Utilitarian may believe their integrity means to
    kill the one person or to take the job.
  * So we only believe premise 2 if you believe the argument.

So we are either left with an unsound argument or a circular argument.

=== Demandingness Objection ===

Depends on us doing things above and beyond

==== The Defense ====

= Class Structure =

* Pull premises out of the articles themselves
  * Try to clarify what the article is trying to say
  * The examples are varied for each of the individual students.
