PHIL1104

# Cultural Relativism
 • The thesis that what is right/wrong depends on what moral beliefs are 
   dominant in the culture you live in.
 • There are no universal moral truths.
 • Don’t do what everyone does, do what the culture believes in.
 • Why we think it’s true?
    ◦ “Respect for Cultures”
       ▸ ie different things people do with their dead
    ◦ Tolerance is important
       ▸ allow other people to behave regarding their culture
       ▸ france is arguing to not allow secularism in schools
    ◦ Condemning radical change
       ▸ things are going too fast → gay rights movement/interracial movement
       ▸ cultural change is forced before prepared
       ▸ activists push too hard too quickly, trying to merge cultures the 
         wrong way
    ◦ Religious or moral integrity
       ▸ to be accepting of what people do regarding their religion
          ▹ Hindus with cows, etc
    ◦ Value-neutrality
       ▸ Describe cultures with their own values, no bias

## Argument from Cultural Differences

We have the argument

 1. Cultures disagree about what is right and wrong
 2. So, what is right and what is wrong is different in different cultures

We can prove this wrong as we have a Psychological idea creating a Moral idea
The structure can also be compared to another invalid argument

 1. In the past, cultures disagreed about whether earth is flat or round.
 2. So the shape differs in correctness depending on the time period.

This holds the same structure but is definitely invalid

## Consequences

 • We can’t have moral heroes because everyone is right
 • Moral progress is doubtful because right&wrong aren’t set
 • There are different kinds of right 
    ◦ Abolition went from “right” → “right”
 • However, there is moral progress, see above
 • So, cultural relativism is wrong

## Assume Correct

Why is there so much disagreement?
 • Often our moral disagreements are about _facts_.

What about tolerance?
 • Do they really have anything to do with each other?
 • ie there’s nothing immoral about a crying baby, but one can be intolerant 
   towards it
 • ie you can tolerate someone piercing their baby’s ears but morally think 
   it’s wrong

## Context still matters
 • Not shaking hands in America would be wrong
 • Shaking hands in Japan would be wrong (as would eye contact w/ superiors)

 • Must you share dinner w/ your neighbor?
    ◦ share if your neighbor needs it (ie not necessary when both have enough)
 • Gossiping about someone’s sex life
    ◦ Not so bad in America, but could be fatal in other countries

# Discussion

 • Formats:
    ◦ If ... Then ...
    ◦ Either ... Or ...
    ◦ ... And ...
    ◦ Not ...
 • Ex 1
    1. Either Obama wins or McCain wins
    2. Obama wins
       ——————————
    4. Therefore, McCain does not win
    ◦ This is only valid if we’re saying exclusive, we have to add
       ▸ *and not both* to make it valid
 • Ex 2
    1. Either Obama wins or McCain wins
    2. McCain does not win
       ——————————
    3. Therefore, Obama wins
    • One of them _HAS_ to be true
 • Ex 3
    1. If A then B
    2. If B then C
    3. Either A or D
    4. Not D
       ——————————
    5. Therefore C
