Alright, so I'm going to head this up with the fact that I doubt I'll be
posting that often when I get down to it. I'm bad with keeping these kinds of
things going, and I know it.

However, I plan on using this blog as a sort of teaching space. Every once in a
while as I learn something new, either from my side projects or from school,
I'll write up a decent post explaining everything that I've learned. I plan on
finding ways to teach the material which is easy to understand, and hopefully
shows an interesting way of using it.

This stems from an idea my friend gave me, where he mentioned that Computer
Science students are taught such a variety of topics. Topics that are
occasionally so abstract that it's hard to tell what use the information really
is. He found a video that explained the way Alan Turing created the decoder for
the German Enigma machine. 

The ideas Turing was able to use showed an actual use of the abstract problem
solving we're taught---something that students seem to no longer get. I plan
on doing what I can to help make some things more understandable.
