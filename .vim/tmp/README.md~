A game that's going to build up to some kind of game; creating a simple
interface first and then prototyping different ideas and working from there.

## Build instructions

Alright, so I only know instructions on how to install with \*nix or Mac. 

On a Mac install SDL2 with

    brew install sdl2

On \*nix, install using the instructions on the [SDL2](http://www.libsdl.org/)
site.

And then it's simple!

    make
    make run

(alternatively, run just the latter, but that'll throw errors if the initial
make fails).
