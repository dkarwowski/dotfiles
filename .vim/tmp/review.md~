# Large Sample Test

$x_1, ..., x_n$ be a random sample from a non-normal population with unknown
mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma$

Our stat is

$$Z= \frac{\bar{X}-\mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}$$

Null distribution is the dist of above when Null hypo. is true

We already have it normalized so approximately $N(0, 1)$

When $n>40$ we can use large sample test

# Large Sample Approximate z Test

Let $\bar{x}$ be the observed mean value of a sample of size $n$ from a pop
with unknown $\mu$ and variance

$$Z = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}$$

To test $H_0 : \mu = \mu_0$ at significant level approximate $2$, the rejection
criteria is

$$
\bar{x}=28.76, s^2 = 12.26^2
$$
$$
Z=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}=-0.73
$$
$$
Z_{\alpha} = Z_0.05 = 1.65
$$
