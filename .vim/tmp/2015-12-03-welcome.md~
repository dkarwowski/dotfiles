Honestly, this is a pretty empty website for now. As it fills up, I’ll try to 
keep everything up to date regarding it. Currently, I’m working through an 
outline of information that I’d like to cover. I’ll be attempting to take ideas
I found interesting, or that I’m forced to learn in class, and simplify them. 
Find the easy, simple idea behind it. The reason why it works.

The plan is to append to my learning and try to explain things to people. It 
comes as an idea from a friend. While video teaching would also be fun, I’m not
the video type.

# Basics

There are some things that you’ll need to know to start off. I’ll try to ensure
each individual post has some links for background information, as well as 
references for where I find my information. There are, however, these basics 
that are important to understand:

 * Boolean Algebra, with basic logical expressions
 * Set Theory, including their properties and actions on them
 * Number Theory, just the basics

I’ll try to create a post that goes over the basics, as well as the notation 
used.
