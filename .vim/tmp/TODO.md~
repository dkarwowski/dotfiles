# Necessary

## near future
- Tile Map
    - [ ] Representation - WTF does this mean?
- Entities
    - [ ] organize active and sleeping entities (distance)
    - [ ] separate position + movement? (not everything has to move)
- Camera
    - [ ] zoom implementation
    - [ ] adjustable tile size

## done?
- Tile Maps
    - [x] render based on within camera distance (add more?)
    - [x] Storage
    - [x] chunks not maps
    - [x] weak generation
- Collision
    - [x] improve precision (currently sticky)
- Create memory stack
    - [x] pushing/popping from stack
    - [x] start putting things on the stack
- Entities
    - [x] camera entity

## far future
- Player initial parameters loading
    - [ ] S-Expression file of params
    - [ ] ... S-Expression parser
- Polyginal collision
- FPS - Limited Sample Average display instead

    - [ ] Smart Delay (don't wait as long if we've been running over time)
