# Data Structures

 • Entities
    ◦ a linked-list structure that references into a pre-allocated array
    ◦ array has some max size
    ◦ custom insert/remove functions
       ▸ must handle removed nodes well (queue of empty spots)
    ◦ can ‘abstract’ out to a more generalized ll
    ◦ create iterators and such using C syntax things
 • Tile Maps
    ◦ Chunks of some size (64x64)?
    ◦ Should chunks know what entities exist in it? ← easier loading?
